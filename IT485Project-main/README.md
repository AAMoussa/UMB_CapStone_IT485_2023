Pawsome Pets

Webapp using Petfinder's API - created a query page using the filters postal code, state, type, gender, age, size, and sort.

Webapp helps locate local pets within 100 mile radius of zipcode. Types of pets include dogs, cats, rabbit, small & furry, horse, bird, scales fins & other, and barnyard. 

Information retreived will then show the pets photo, name, gender, age a small portion of their description, if they are good with dogs, cats, and kids. It will show the animals breeds and coat type as well. The final portion of information given to the user is the contact information of the organization that houses the pet. There is a link to the Petfinder website to learn more about the pet/organization.
